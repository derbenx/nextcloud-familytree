<h1>Family Tree app for nextcloud</h1>
<h3>A Nextcloud app that lets you design freeform family trees.</h3>

You can now import GED file. The connection lines work, but the files are sorted by generation only. You will have to manually sort them until I figure out how I want to do this nicer.
This app now has 2 language translations. I am only fluent in English, google translate did the other two, feel free to blame it if it's wrong.
To add your own translation, open the translate.js in the js folder. Copy the English line and convert it to your own words. The app auto detects any new languages added. Make a backup, any updates of the app will erase your changes. Updates could also alter the structure of the file as features are added.

Added resize bar, works under FireFox, kinda works under Chrome if you slowly move the mouse. Not tested for any other browser.


Nextcloud Hub 10 (31.0.6) is compatible, the icons at the top may look funny, but the app does still work!
