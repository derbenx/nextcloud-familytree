<h1>Family Tree app for nextcloud</h1>
<h3>A Nextcloud app that lets you design freeform family trees.</h3>
</p>

This app now has 2 language translations. I only am fluent in English, google translate did the other two, feel free to blame it if it's wrong.
To add your own translation, open the translate.js in the js folder. Copy the English line and convert it to your own words. The app auto detects any new languages added. Make a backup, any updates of the app will erase your changes. Updates could also alter the structure of the file as features are added.
